Good afternoon, and thank you for having me.

I’m **Varghese**, and I really enjoy being productive and working on projects that make an impact. As a **Software Implementation Engineer**, I’ve worked on deploying enterprise software, supporting clients during go-lives, and making sure transitions are smooth — both technically and through clear communication.

Along the way, I’ve strengthened my skills in **SQL, troubleshooting, and enterprise tech solutions**, and I love finding ways to solve problems efficiently. I’m excited about the possibility of bringing my experience and energy to your team and contributing right from the start.

**About SunTec Xelerate** is a cloud-native, microservices-based platform that helps organizations transform into agile, customer-first businesses. It enables customer-centric engagement through advanced product management, enterprise pricing, revenue optimization, and partner ecosystem management.

# Software Implementation Challenge: Xelerate System

## Situation

While implementing an **Xelerate system** for a financial institution, we faced a major roadblock — their legacy customer details and fee data were scattered across multiple Excel files, with inconsistent formats and duplicate records. The client also had a strict **go-live deadline** before the start of their new financial year.

## Task

My responsibility was to ensure all **legacy data** — both financial (fees, balances, payments) and non-financial (customer records) — was migrated accurately into the new system, **without causing delays** to the go-live date.

## Action

To address the challenge, I took the following steps:

1. **Data Analysis:** Identified gaps, duplicates, and incorrect formats in the old datasets.
2. **Field Mapping:** Mapped each legacy field to the new system’s structure and documented transformation rules.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Developed SQL scripts to clean and standardize data formats, such as splitting full names, aligning date formats, and converting currency values.
4. **Client Collaboration:** Worked closely with the client to reconcile data by cross-verifying totals, counts, and random samples.
5. **Testing:** Conducted data integrity testing with client stakeholders and functional tool testing to ensure smooth operation in the new SunTec Xelerate system.

## Result

- Migrated over **98% of legacy data** without errors.
- Reduced **manual correction work by 75%**.
- Went **live 3 days ahead of schedule**.
- The client praised the smooth transition, and the success of this project led to them purchasing additional **SunTec Xelerate modules** from us.
